## [fit] What I don’t cover

* This is just an intro.
* I don’t cover LLDB commands.
* The debugger has a whole CL interface that is very powerful.
* 🎗 Instead of learning LLDB commands become a unit test master!

## [fit] Print Tricks 🧘🏼‍♂️

---

```objc
// Objc

NSLog(@"%d: %s", __LINE__, __PRETTY_FUNCTION__);

```

---

```swift
// Swift

/*
#file
#function
#line
#column
*/

// print is a variadic function

print(#file, #function, #line, #column)

```


---

**Convenience methods in Objc for converting C primitives to NSString**

```objc

CGRect rect = CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 100);
NSLog(@"%@", NSStringFromCGRect(rect));

NSLog(@"%@", @(10).stringValue);

// Swift treats CGRect as a Swift Struct! 🙃
print(rect)

```

## The Good & 💩 of Print

**Good**
- Easy, immediate, essential
  
**Bad**
-  Called “cowboy debugging” for reason
- Can introduce bugs. (You're adding testing to production code. Don't.)
- Need to be removed before shipping.
- DLog/ALog & other alternatives automatically removed from release builds.
- Swift automatically removes Assert from release builds.
- Makes code harder to read.
- "Busy console" problem. (Solution: print the line/function in the console).

```swift
// Eg.
print("======>>>>>>!!!!!! HEY !!!!!!!<<<<<<=========")

```

---

## NSAssert/Assert

* We’ve seen Asserts in the tests exercise (eg. XCTestAssertNil()), and unit testing lecture.
* Plain Asserts are functions that take 2 parameters.
  * The first parameter is some statement that is being asserted to be *true*.
  * The second, optional parameter, is a message that is logged only if the assertion fails. (This can be a format string).
* Assertions assert something to be true, and if that statement is not true the app crashes and dumps the message to the console.

```objc

// Objc
NSAssert(self.data, @"data should not be nil");

NSAssert(self.data.count == 20, 
@"%@ was expected to be equal to 20", 
@(self.data.count).stringValue);

```

```swift
// Swift
let num = 10
assert(num == 10, 
"This message will not run because num is 10")
assert(num == 11, 
"\(num) is not equal to 11")

```

## Question
- Why would you ever want to force your app to crash?

## Problem with Asserts
- They should be removed from production code (automatic in Swift).
- But you can use macros that automatically remove them from production code in Objc (eg. ZAssert).
- You’re adding code to your *app* target to do testing. Don't.
- Might as well write unit tests instead! Unit tests are asserts. But they live in a separate target from your production code. Much smarter. **UNIT TESTS == BETTER**.
- But for quick tests in an app that isn’t using unit tests, it’s a reasonable choice.

## [fit] Folding Ribbon

* Ribbon folding was removed from Xcode 9.
* Xcode 9 supports a version of the Ribbon Folding by holding down ⌘ + bring the mouse pointer over the first word in a function or class.
* Great for solving scope issues.
* But it’s likely a "code smell" if you have to use the ribbon to figure out your scopes.
* Repeated conditional statements or switches ARE almost always a code smell.

## [fit] Instruments

* Xcode has a massive instruments feature used for debugging and performance tuning.
* We’ll just look very briefly at two of the most useful instruments.
  * Allocations: takes a snapshot of all of the objects your app allocates, retains and releases.
  * Time Profiler: gives you data on how long your app is spending running various methods.

## Debugging Strategies

 **🎗Avoid stabbing in the dark 🔪. THINK 🤔 before acting.**

**Prepare**

  - mentally ("I can do this!").
  - consider running *clean*, delete derived data (~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData), REBOOT!
  
**Damage Control**

- mitigate against anything that might go wrong. (Backup!)

**Describe problem thoroughly**

- describe the *precise* conditions that trigger *unexpected* behaviour. 
- if you need more info, gather it.

  
---
  
## More Debugging Strategies...

**Reproduce the problem**

- be able to reproduce the problem at will
- intermittent problems will make this difficult/impossible

**Form a causal hypothesis**

- start with obvious and easy to test hypotheses
- THINK, don’t just start stabbing in the dark (e.g. commenting out lines **superstitiously**)
- aim to find root cause
  
---

## More Debugging Strategies...

**Fix it!**

- understand the fix before you make it
- make sure you are solving the root cause

**Test**

- make sure you really have solved the issue
- make sure you haven't acidentally introduced new problems

---

## More Debugging Strategies...

**Reflect/Document**

- keep a Solutions Log (document it)
- reflect on your solution

**Prevent future occurrences**

- learn your lesson

---

## 🎗Debugging Tips

- Blame yourself!! ("user error" 🤔)
- Always take any compiler errors seriously. Decrypt them first. Search SO if the error makes no sense
- Solve problems yourself before looking them up on SO
- Consider that a problem might have more than a single cause. 

---

## More🎗Debugging Tips

-  Avoid complex problems by a practice of continuous testing. Better yet use TDD.
- When building always try to get your code to a testable state, test and then move to building the next component.
- Learn to write unit tests.
